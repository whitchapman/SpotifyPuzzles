SpotifyPuzzles
==============

In the past, Spotify challenged job seekers with puzzles.  It looks like they are no longer listed; however, the pages are archived at the Wayback Machine; links couresy of my friend, [Matthew Davidson](https://github.com/KingMob).

I plan to solve all of these puzzles using Java and/or C++.  Details are in the individual puzzle's README.
